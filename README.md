# Machine Learning Foundations & Algorithms Portfolio

This repository is a structured collection of my **machine learning learning journey**, where I implement concepts **from scratch and using libraries** as I study them.
Every notebook represents a concept I have learned, practiced, and committed for long-term understanding.

> 📌 Goal: Build strong ML fundamentals and practical intuition by learning → implementing → documenting.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

* Every concept is implemented **hands-on**
* Focus on **why** a method works, not just how
* Combination of:

  * Scratch implementations
  * `scikit-learn` based pipelines
* Clean, well-named notebooks for easy revision

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
