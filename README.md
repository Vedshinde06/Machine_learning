# Machine Learning Foundations and Algorithms Portfolio

This repository contains a structured collection of machine learning concepts that I have learned and implemented hands-on.  
Each notebook represents a topic studied in depth, focusing on practical understanding through implementation.

The goal of this repository is to build strong machine learning fundamentals by learning concepts, implementing them, and documenting the results.
